# 📘 RoboCap: Natural Language Scene Descriptions for Robots
RoboCap is a vision-to-language system that generates natural-language descriptions of what a robot sees.

Using the COCO dataset and a multimodal CV + NLP pipeline, RoboCap converts raw images into clear, structured captions optimized for robotic perception and assistive robotics applications.

This project explores how image captioning can support robotic systems that need to navigate, understand, and interact with real-world environments.

# 🧠 Motivation
Robots often perceive the world through cameras but lack the ability to summarize visual information in language.
Natural-language descriptions give robots:
- Human-friendly explanations of what they see
- Context for decision-making
- Improved interpretability in assistive or domestic settings
- A bridge between vision and communication
RoboCap aims to demonstrate how image captioning can serve as a foundational module for robot awareness.

# 📚 Dataset
RoboCap uses the COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context), which contains:
- 118k training images
- 5k validation images
- 5 captions per image

# 📊 Expected Outcomes
By the end of the project, RoboCap will:
- Generate readable captions from unseen images
- Highlight actions and objects relevant to robot navigation
